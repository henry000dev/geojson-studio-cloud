> **Stability:** volatile. A dated, append-at-top log of what's been done and where things were left. **Read this first on resuming.** Newest entry at the top.

## 2026-06-23 — Planning complete; planning repo set up

- Agreed the full architecture and rollout for the Cloud epic (see [`00-overview.md`](00-overview.md) through [`04-backlog.md`](04-backlog.md)).
- Named the effort the **Cloud epic**; brand is **"Cloud"**; this planning repo is **`geojson-studio-cloud`**, a sibling to app/api/resources.
- Wrote the doc set: overview, architecture, decisions (ADR-001…009), rollout, backlog, this worklog.
- **Status:** parked, pre-implementation. No code written in either code repo yet.

### Setup tasks — all done
- ✅ `git init`, first commit, pushed to remote.
- ✅ Back-pointers added: `geojson-studio-app/CLAUDE.md` and `geojson-studio-api/CLAUDE.md` each reference `../geojson-studio-cloud` (with a "read before working on accounts/auth/cloud-storage" trigger). The pre-existing app↔api sibling pointers were kept.
- ✅ `geojson-studio-app/docs/cloud-accounts-plan.md` reduced to a one-line redirect to this repo (superseded by this doc set).

### Where to resume
- **Next action:** Phase 0 — introduce the document-storage and settings-KV provider seams as a behaviour-preserving no-op; validate by the existing Playwright suite passing unchanged. See [`03-rollout.md`](03-rollout.md#phase-0--branch-by-abstraction-no-flag-no-user-visible-change).
